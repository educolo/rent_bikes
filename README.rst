Settings

Moved to settings_.

Basic Commands
--------------

Setting Up Your Users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

* To create an **superuser account**, use this command::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar), so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

Test coverage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report::

    $ coverage run manage.py test
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

Running tests with py.test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

  $ py.test

Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moved to `Live reloading and SASS compilation`_.

Dev Deployment with Docker
--------------------------

Build the Stack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This can take a while, especially the first time you run this particular command
on your development system::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml build

If you want to build the production environment you use ``production.yml`` as -f argument (``docker-compose.yml`` or ``docker-compose.yaml`` are the defaults).

Boot the System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This brings up both Django and PostgreSQL.

The first time it is run it might take a while to get started, but subsequent
runs will occur quickly.

Open a terminal at the project root and run the following for local development::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml up

You can also set the environment variable ``COMPOSE_FILE`` pointing to ``local.yml`` like this::

    $ export COMPOSE_FILE=local.yml

And then run::

    $ docker-compose up

Running management commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As with any shell command that we wish to run in our container, this is done
using the ``docker-compose -f local.yml run`` command.

To migrate your app and to create a superuser, run::

    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run django python manage.py migrate
    $ docker-compose -f local.yml run django python manage.py createsuperuser

Here we specify the ``django`` container as the location to run our management commands.


Docker details
